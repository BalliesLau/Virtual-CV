<b>Hosting:</b><br/><i> The CV website is hosted on GitHub, where the progress of the web development 
is logged.</i><br/>
<b>Innovation:</b><br/><i> In the CV I added my name as big and neat as needed, with tabs for navigation 
if someone needs to quickly check info.<br/>
with the gradients of the colors, I was looking for colors that are as close to blue as 
possible, but have a sense of progression.<br/>
A photo of me and personal details with my CV as a PDF.<br/>
The dropdown on the photo is there just for an extra add-on, when I played around.<br/>
The animation where the information section is there to keep the viewers on the section at 
hand but then to have attention drawn to the next section.</i><br/>
<b>Web technologies:</b><br/><i> In this web development I used the famous HTML to create the 
backbone of the site, JavaScript for the integration, and CSS for the color and style 
formatting.</i><br/>
<b>Compatibility:</b><br/><i> The website does work fine on Chrome, mobile, and Edge as far as the 
resources that I have.</i><br/>
<b>Navigation:</b><br/><i> As lightly mentioned in innovation, I have tabs that seamlessly navigate to the 
sections the viewer wants to see.</i>
